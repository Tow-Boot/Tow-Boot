NixOS
=====

The *NixOS Wiki* installation notes for UEFI on NixOS on ARM should be
followed.

They will refer back to Tow-Boot as a source of *Platform Firmware*. You will
need to know that Tow-Boot cannot write to EFI variables.

The installation is similar to what it would be with `x86_64`. The main issues
are noted on the Wiki page.
